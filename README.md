# Stock_Price_Prediction_Model

# Project Objective:

To build a robust and interpretable stock price prediction system for Reliance Industries Ltd. using a combination of:

- Power BI for real-world data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.

- Python & Machine Learning to engineer features, train regression models, and evaluate performance.

The objective is to predict the next day's closing price using historical stock data and visualize key market patterns that influence stock behavior. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow from data wrangling to model deployment.

#  Power BI Role:

In this project, Power BI was used for:

- Cleaning raw stock market data

- Transforming and standardizing column data types

- Handling missing values using built-in Power Query features

- Removing irrelevant or duplicate rows (if any)

- Exporting the cleaned dataset as reliance_cleaned.csv for ML processing
