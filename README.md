# Project Objective

To build a robust and interpretable stock price prediction system for Reliance Industries Ltd. using a combination of:

-Power BI for real-world data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.

-Python & Machine Learning to engineer features, train regression models, and evaluate performance.

The objective is to predict the next day's closing price using historical stock data and visualize key market patterns that influence stock behavior. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow from data wrangling to model deployment readiness
